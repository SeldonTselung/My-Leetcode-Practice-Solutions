# My-Leetcode-Practice-Solutions

Compiling all the leetcode problems I have practiced so far, with an explanation of
my approach and my coded solution.

I try my best to optimize time and space and as such AVOID taking shortcuts or using built-in methods if they add unnecessary time or modify the original data.

I spent several hours, weeks and months to understand the fundamentals of data structures through several different resources.

Online resources:
Udemy, Codecademy,YouTube, Structy, Educative, LinkedIn Learning, LeetCode

Books:
Cracking the coding interview

I jumped back and forth between understanding a data structure and then solving problems pertaining to it. Then moving on to another data structure. It's easy to get demotivated when you come across a problem that's hard to even comprehend what they're asking for. But looking up solutions and debugging step by step breaks the problem into simple steps that seem more familiar and less daunting.

Also, just a suggestion, never try to memorize solutions. I used to memorize math and physics formulas as a kid. But algorithms don't operate through plug and chug strategy. They teach you how to reason and recognize patterns. If you can achieve that, then you can attempt to solve any problem. In the meantime, challenge your thought process.

Enough said, it's time to algo!
