# My-Leetcode-Practice-Solutions

Compiling all the leetcode problems I have practiced so far, with an explanation of
my approach and my coded solution.

I try my best to optimize time and space and as such AVOID taking shortcuts or using built-in methods if they add unnecessary time or modify the original data.

I got introduced to algorithms this year (2022). At first I felt lost because I jumped into Leetcode without really spending any time on the fundamentals. Having a strong background in mechanical engineering definitely helped with understanding what a problem was asking for and how to tackle it but translating that into an efficient javascript solution is a journey that cannot be rushed or mastered in a day. But if I can do it, anyone can.

There was a time when I was clueless on easy problems or had the most brute solution. But with practice, it became easier and easier. Some of the folks I chatted with that got into Google have solved around 600 - 900 leetcode problems. So you know that practice definitely helps.

So when you read my solutions, do note that it's the culmination of several hours of understanding the fundamentals of data structures first through several different resources.

Online resources:
Udemy, Codecademy,YouTube, Structy, Educative, LinkedIn Learning, LeetCode

Books:
Cracking the coding interview

I jumped back and forth between understanding a data structure and then solving problems pertaining to it. Then moving on to another data structure. It's easy to get demotivated when you come across a problem that's hard to even understand. But that's when I started looking up example applications of data structures and that made the problems seem familiar and less daunting.

Also, never try to memorize solutions. I used to memorize math and physics formulas as a kid. It's easy. But algorithms are far more than that. They teach you how to reason and recognize patterns. I honestly am enjoying this learning process. It's like solving mini puzzles for fun.

Enough said, time to code!
